;;; Commentary:

;; The vim-tab-bar Emacs package enhances the built-in tab-bar with a
;; minimalist, Vim-inspired design that automatically adapts to the current
;; Emacs theme as well as any themes loaded subsequently. This ensures the
;; tab-bar integrates with the rest of the Emacs interface, eliminating visual
;; conflicts and making it feel like a natural extension of your Emacs
;; environment.
;;
;; Beyond its Vim-inspired design, the vim-tab-bar package is valued by users
;; who prioritize theme consistency, as it integrates the Emacs tab-bar with any
;; Emacs theme, producing a visually coherent and polished interface.
