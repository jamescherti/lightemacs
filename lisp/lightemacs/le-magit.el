;;; Commentary:

;; Magit provides a comprehensive interface to the Git version control system.
;; It aims to serve as a full-featured Git porcelain. Although it does not yet
;; cover every Git command, it is sufficiently complete to enable even
;; experienced Git users to perform nearly all their routine version control
;; tasks entirely within Emacs.
