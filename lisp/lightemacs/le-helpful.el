;;; Commentary:

;; Helpful enhances the built-in help system by providing richer, more
;; contextual information about symbols, functions, variables, and macros.
;; Unlike the default `describe-*` commands, Helpful integrates additional
;; metadata such as source code, documentation strings, keybindings, references,
;; and interactive examples, all within a unified and easily navigable buffer.
