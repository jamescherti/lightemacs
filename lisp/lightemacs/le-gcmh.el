;;; Commentary:

;; Gcmh (Garbage Collector Magic Hack) optimizes Emacsâ€™ garbage collection
;; behavior by adjusting the garbage collection threshold dynamically. Instead
;; of collecting memory frequently during normal editing, gcmh increases the
;; threshold while Emacs is idle, reducing interruptions and improving perceived
;; performance. It also restores the threshold during active usage to prevent
;; excessive memory use. In essence, it makes Emacs feel more responsive by
;; tuning garbage collection automatically.
