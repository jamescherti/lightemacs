;;; Commentary:

;; Evil is an extensible vi layer for Emacs. It emulates the main features of
;; Vim, and provides facilities for writing custom extensions.
;;
;; This configures the packages evil and evil-collection.

;;; Code:

;; When prescient.el is used with Corfu, prescient.el improves both in-buffer
;; completions and pop-up completion menus by making candidate ordering more
;; predictable and adaptive to recent usage, thus speeding up repeated
;; selections.
;;
;; Example: If you frequently choose the completion "printf" when editing C
;; code, prescient.el will gradually move "printf" toward the top of the list
;; whenever similar candidates are offered, reducing the number of keystrokes
;; needed to select it.
;;
;; (prescient.el is a library for sorting and filtering lists of candidates,
;; such as those presented by packages like Vertico or Corfu. The main benefit
;; of prescient.el is that it adaptively orders candidates based on both
;; frequency and recency of selection, making frequently used options appear
;; first without sacrificing predictable filtering results.)
