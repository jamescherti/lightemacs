;;; Commentary:

;; Eat (Emulate A Terminal) is a terminal emulator implemented entirely in Emacs
;; Lisp. It supports full-screen terminal applications such as Emacs itself and
;; offers high performance, operating over three times faster than Term. Eat
;; provides advanced features like Sixel graphics, complete mouse support, shell
;; integration, and reduced screen flicker for smoother performance. Configuring
;; shell integration is recommended to fully utilize its capabilities.
