;;; Commentary:

;; `electric-indent-mode' is sufficient to maintain proper code alignment during
;; straightforward typing. However, when you begin shifting code blocks,
;; transposing lines, or manipulating s-expressions, indentation inconsistencies
;; are likely to occur.
;;
;; `aggressive-indent-mode' is a minor mode that ensures code remains
;; consistently indented. It automatically reindents after every modification,
;; providing greater reliability than `electric-indent-mode'.
