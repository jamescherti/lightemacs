  "In Evil insert state, make `C-h' behave like the `DEL' key.

Correct `C-h' behavior to ensure `electric-pair' deletes adjacent pairs When
using `electric-pair-mode', the expected behavior when pressing `C-h' near a
pair of adjacent delimiters (e.g., () [] {}) is that both the opening and
closing delimiters should be deleted together if they were inserted as a pair.
This function corrects `C-h' behavior to ensure `electric-pair' deletes adjacent
pairs.

This function also prevents ElDoc help from disappearing in the minibuffer when
pressing `C-h', since it is prefixed with `evil-delete'."

  ;; Fixes #1974: Correct C-h behavior to ensure electric-pair deletes adjacent
  ;; pairs When using electric-pair-mode, the expected behavior when pressing
  ;; C-h near a pair of adjacent delimiters (e.g., () [] {} "") is that both the
  ;; opening and closing delimiters should be deleted together if they were
  ;; inserted as a pair. This pull request fixes #1974. This pull request
  ;; corrects C-h behavior to ensure electric-pair deletes adjacent pairs. It
  ;; calls the same function as DEL (code 127) in electric-pair-mode-map:
  (when (bound-and-true-p evil-want-C-h-delete)
