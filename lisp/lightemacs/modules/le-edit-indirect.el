;;; Commentary:

;; The `edit-indirect' package enhances `markdown-mode' by allowing users to
;; edit individual code blocks in separate, isolated buffers without affecting
;; the surrounding Markdown content. When editing a fenced code block,
;; `edit-indirect' automatically opens it in a buffer with the appropriate major
;; mode (e.g., `python-mode' for Python code), providing full syntax
;; highlighting, indentation, and other language-specific features. This makes
;; it easier to work on embedded code snippets as if they were standalone files,
;; improving clarity, and reducing the risk of accidentally altering text
;; outside the block.
