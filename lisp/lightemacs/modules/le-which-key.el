;;; Commentary:

;; The `which-key' mode dynamically displays available keybindings in a popup or
;; dedicated buffer as a key sequence is entered. It facilitates discovery and
;; retention of key combinations by presenting context-sensitive completions,
;; thereby enhancing navigation through complex or highly customized keymaps.

   ;; Slot for side window display. `which-key' uses a side window to show key
   ;; suggestions.
   ;;
   ;; This determines the layering order of this window relative to other side
   ;; windows (like compilation buffers, help buffers, or other popup windows).
   ;; Negative values, such as -10, push the which-key window behind most other
   ;; side windows, preventing it from covering or overlapping important
   ;; content.
   ;;
   ;; Setting a highly negative slot can cause the which-key window to
   ;; appear "below" other side windows, which may make it less immediately
   ;; noticeable. If another window pops up with a higher slot, which-key may be
   ;; partially hidden or layered awkwardly.
