;;; Commentary:

;; Gcmh (Garbage Collector Magic Hack) optimizes Emacsâ€™ garbage collection
;; behavior by adjusting the garbage collection threshold dynamically. Instead
;; of collecting memory frequently during normal editing, gcmh increases the
;; threshold while Emacs is idle, reducing interruptions and improving perceived
;; performance. It also restores the threshold during active usage to prevent
;; excessive memory use. In essence, it makes Emacs feel more responsive by
;; tuning garbage collection automatically.

(use-package gcmh
  :commands gcmh-mode
  :hook (lightemacs-on-first-buffer . gcmh-mode)
  :init
  (setq gcmh-verbose init-file-debug
        gcmh-auto-idle-delay-factor 10
        gcmh-high-cons-threshold (* 128 1024 1024))

  ;; This variable determines how long Emacs should wait (in seconds) while
  ;; being idle before triggering garbage collection. "Idle" here means no
  ;; keyboard or mouse input is received for the specified period.
