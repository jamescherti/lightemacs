;;; Commentary:
;; evil-snipe provides two-character motions for rapid navigation within text,
;; similar to Evilâ€™s built-in f/F/t/T commands, but with incremental
;; highlighting of potential targets as you type. By default, s (forward) and
;; S (backward) are bound to evil-snipe-s and evil-snipe-S, respectively.
;;
;; Pressing s in normal mode prompts you to type two characters, then jumps the
;; cursor to the nearest matching occurrence while highlighting all matches
;; incrementally.
