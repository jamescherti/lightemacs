;;; Reduce cluttering

;; Emacs, by default, stores various configuration files, caches, backups, and
;; other data in the ~/.emacs.d directory. Over time, this directory can become
;; cluttered with numerous files, making it difficult to manage and maintain.
;;
;; A common solution to this issue is installing the no-littering package;
;; however, this package is not essential.
;;
;; An alternative lightweight approach is to simply change the default
;; ~/.emacs.d directory to ~/.emacs.d/var/, which will contain all the files
;; that Emacs typically stores in the base directory.
